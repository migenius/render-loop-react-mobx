/**
 * @class BatchCommand
 * A batch command is a special
 * command that can have any number of sub-commands. The batch command 
 * is processed as a single command and gets only a single reply
 * from the server. The sub-commands can't have individual response 
 * handlers, but the Response class has helper methods that 
 * makes it easier to process the sub-command results of a batch 
 * command.
 * 
 * Batch commands can be nested, meaning that a batch command can
 * have sub-commands that are in turn batch commands and so on. 
 * Batch commands can not contain commands that return binary data 
 * such as the "render" command.

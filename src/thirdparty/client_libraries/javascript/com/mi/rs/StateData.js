/**
 * @class com.mi.rs.StateData
 * This interface encapsulates the data that is used by the 
 * RealityServer state handlers to decide which state commands are 
 * processed in. The state data can be specified when adding 
 * commands directly to the service, or when regstering a process
 * commands callback. All commands added in a specific callback
 * will operate in the same state. A default state data can also
 * be set on the service itself. This state will then be used for all
 * commands where an explicit state data has not been specified.
 * 
 * <p>States is an optional RealityServer mechanism that can be used
 * to control the scope in which RealityServer commands are executed 
 * and how URL paths are mapped to the content root among other 
 * things. The state handler is a customizable server side component 
 * that decides the state commands should be executed in based on 
 * the data specified by this interface. </p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Note: The StateData class 
 * is designed to be constant. It is not safe to change any members of
 * a StateData object after it has been created, instead a new StateData 
 * instance must be created and used if the state data needs to change.</b>
 * </p>
